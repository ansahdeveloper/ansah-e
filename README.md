Requests (for API calls)
Installation
1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local or cloud server:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/ansahdeveloper/ansah-e.git
cd ansah-e
2. Set Up Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)
It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
3. Install Dependencies
Install all required Python dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory of your project and add the following configuration:

env
Copy code
FLASK_APP=app.py
FLASK_ENV=production
PORT=5000
MODEL_NAME=mistral-7b  # You can change this based on your model setup
Make sure to replace values as necessary (e.g., model path, API keys if needed).

5. Run the Application Locally for Testing
You can test the application locally before deploying it:

bash
Copy code
flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000
This will start the app on http://127.0.0.1:5000. Test it using Postman or cURL.

Deploying in Production
To deploy the app in a production environment using Gunicorn (WSGI server), follow these steps:

1. Install Gunicorn
If you haven't already installed Gunicorn, add it to your requirements or install directly:

bash
Copy code
pip install gunicorn
2. Run the App with Gunicorn
Use Gunicorn to serve the Flask app in production. For example:

bash
Copy code
gunicorn --workers=4 --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
This will run the application on port 5000 with 4 worker processes to handle requests.

3. Deploy to Cloud Hosting Providers (Optional)
For production deployments, you can deploy Ansah E to cloud hosting platforms like AWS, Heroku, Google Cloud, or DigitalOcean. Ensure your environment variables are properly set on these platforms, and consider using Docker for containerization for more consistency across environments.

4. Set Up Reverse Proxy (Optional)
In a production environment, it's common to set up a reverse proxy using Nginx or Apache to handle incoming traffic and forward it to your Gunicorn server.

Example Nginx configuration:

nginx
Copy code
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
